Encapsulation:         ( is like  medication)
    It is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts.
    It says Create classes to write code and store data.
    use private access modifiers  to secure the data by limiting the access.
    Create getter setter method for every field if you want others to change or see those fields.

Why should we learn about Encapsulation?
    It improves the control over the data that we store in the fields of a class
    which leads us to more secure code.

Collections framework:
    Collections framework in java contains a lot of classes and interfaces.
    Which help us store and manipulate large amounts of data easily and
    efficiently.

Why Collections framework:
    Arrays have limitations
    1) They are fixed in size meaning once we provide the size we can't
    change it afterwards.
    2) They don't have any built-in methods to help us process the data.

    My note:
    for encapsulation whenever you want to create class, make it private  and for every field  create two method
    getter and setter for user to read and change it. ex: like bank lock has key  and the manager also have the key to access it.
    getter( read)
    setter (change, modify. update)
    ROLE Encapsulation:
    1: create class
    2:if you want to store some data realated to class , create field and make them private
    3: create method to execute
    4: those filed if you want other to see , create getter method,
    for those field for other to change, create setter .
    method.
    5: for those field that you dont want others to  change , set them final and private.
