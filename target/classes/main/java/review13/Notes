What is File?





-Data also store in harddrive, we only move it to ram ( temporary )when we want to process it .ex: When we want to
 write loop, you move it to Ram so you can work on it.It is temporary and it is fast.
-Storage is permanent storage but Rame is temporary storage and it is super fast.
