File?

 File is something that we use to store information.
 For example:
 1)txt files are used to store raw text.
 2) pdf files are usually used to store books and articles.
 3) xlsx files are usually used to store information in the form of a table.
 4) .jpg .jpeg .png files are used to store images
 5) .mp4 .mkv .mov are used to store videos.

Why we use files?
    Its easier to move the information around because it just one single file.
Folders/Directories:
    Its like a container for files. it can contain many different files.
    We use it to organize the information.

File Handling:
    File is process of creating/editing/accessing/deleting the
    files on a computer with the
    help of a programming language.


Steps to work with file:

1) to locate the file usually we use the absolute paths (complete address or path ) for that.
 ex:  "C:users/syntax/desktop/batch17/names/text"
 c - driver
 users - folder
names- file
.text- type of file
2)  we need to have access and a piece of software that can edit/open that file.
3) To bring files from permanent storage in to the Ram. (since Ram is temporary and fast storage , we bring the file
to Ram then back  move it to permanent storage.

What is RAM?
    Temporary storage its very Fast but very expensive and does not store data permanently
    once we turn off the computer everything that we put in the RAM is gone.

What is HDD/SSD/NVME/Storage:

    Its the permanent storage that we use to store things its cheap but slow.

Why should we learn about FileHandling?

    1)So that we can store the data permanent.
    2) We can store the sensitive data like userNames passwords etc inside the
    files and keep them secure on our computers and don't push it with code on
    github.
    3) All the configuration related information like URLS and types of testing
    will also be stored in the files.
