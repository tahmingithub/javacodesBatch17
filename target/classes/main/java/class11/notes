String Class:
    String class is designed to store symbols (letters(A, d,C) numbers(10,25),
    special characters(#,$,%)) in teh form of a group. There are many methods
    already written by java developers that we can just use. This is the most widely sued class in java.
    for example:
    length()
    statsWith()
    endsWith()
    contains()

 Why we should learn about this class.
    1) very important for coding questions
    2)most widely used class in all java
    3)Most of the information in real life is present in the form of strings

Method chaining:
when multiple methods are being called on teh ame line its called method chaining.
String class support methods changing. for method changing to work
previous method must return the expected datatype fir te next method

       Example
       String str="   Batch 17 IS GREAT.    ";
             System.out.println(str.toLowerCase().trim().replace("great","Good"));
           //  System.out.println(str.toLowerCase().isEmpty().replace("great","Good"));

 Note:
    Very important for coding questions.
    1) If else
    2)Loops
    3)Arrays
    4)Strings
