Maps:    It is like dictionary
    Maps are dataStructures which stores key values pairs.
    There are many different types of maps in java but we will be discussing:

    1: HashMap 2: LinkedHashMap  3: TreeMap  4: HashTable.
    Maps are not part of the collections framework.
    Map is the name of the interface and HashMap, LinkedHashMap , TreeMao and HashTable are the classes that implement
    this interface.
Why we should learn about Maps:
    All the other dataStructures that we have learned can only store one value at a time and they are index based.
    Maps allow us to store key values pairs which makes them a better joice because we know what we are storing.

    Maps is interface and  HashMap, LinkedHashMap and TreeMap and HashTable is classes.

Syntax of ArrayList : ***
NameOfTheClass<DataType>  variableName= new NameOfTheClass<>();
ArrayList<String> names= new ArrayList<>();    // we store one value

SSyntax of Maps:   ***
NNameOfTheClass<DataTypeOfKey, DataTypeOfValue>  variableName= new NameOfTheClass<>();
HashMap<String, Double> names = new HshMap<>();

for Map=> we can use put not add to add names

My note :Syntax for ArrayList, LinkedList and Sets
//ArrayList<DataType> nameForArrayList(variable)=new ArrayList<>();
        //LinkedList<DataType> nameForLinkedList=new LinkedList<>();
        //Arraylist, linkedlist and sets has the same formula
        //set<DataType> nameFor set(variable)=new set<>();
       for ArrayList, LinkedList and set=>  we can use add to add names

       ///NameOfTheClass<DataTypeOfKey, DataTypeOfValue>  variableName= new NameOfTheClass<>();
       Map<String, Double >student=new HashMap<>(); => we use put to add names in Map
       remove method is not present in Map
