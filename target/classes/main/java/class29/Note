Types of Errors in Java:
    There are three main types of errors in java.
    1) Syntax errors/compile Time errors-      (compiler means list of error)  ex: age  in =10;
    2) Logical errors/bugs -       when we want largest number which 20 and it print out 3 instead of 20
    3) Runtime Errors/Exceptions-     when we get error when we run or execute it .
  run time shows the name of package, class name, and line #

IDE-> integrated development environment. in our case its intellij
Syntax errors/Compile Time errors
    Example
    int age=10;
    age int=10;
how to solve Syntax errors/Compile Time errors?
    1) Most of the time your IDE (intellij) is going to help you.
    2) Compiler will also generate an error with line numbers and
    explanations.
    3) You can look for the rules of that language.
Logical Errors/bugs:
    Logical occur when programs do not generate the expected outputs.
How to fix these types of errors?
    we can use debugger to fix these types of errors.
Runtime errors/Exceptions:
       Runtime errors or exceptions are unwanted events that disrupts the
       normal flow of a program.
