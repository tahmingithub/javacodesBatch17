MethodOverridding:  override means again write
    When we have exact same methods in parent and  child class. We call it method Overridding.
Why should we learn about overridding:
    Method overrdiding gives us alot of flexibility. EX: if we dont like method from the parent class we can override it
    meaning we can change it.
 Syntax:
 class parent {
 void eat(){           // method
 sout  "Fish"           // Fish
 }
 }
 Class Child extends parent{
 void eat() {           // method
 sout "Chicken"         // we change fish to chicken
 }
 }
