Abstraction:   means method with out implement details (no body method) .

    Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details( means hide  body of method)
    and showing only the functionality to the end user. We use the abstract keyword with methods
    to avoid the implementation details .   ex:   void speak();  we hide in here the sout part (implementation)
Why should we use Abstraction?
    1) Flexibility(if we don't know or don't want to provide the implementation
    we can skip it).
Rules:
   1) we can't create the objects of the abstract classes.
   2) All the child classes must provide the implementation to the abstract
   methods which are coming from parent or mark the child class also abstract.
   3) An Abstract class can have full body methods as well as abstract method.
   4) we can have instance or static fields in a an abstract class.
   5) Constructors are also allowed.




My Note:  -Constract means we
          -concrete class means we
