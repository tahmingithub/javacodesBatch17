Object Oriented Programming: (OOP)
It is just a way (Set of rules) of writing code.
It basically helps us write large amounts of code. That is easier to change and manage. There are other ways like functional
programming and procedural  programming.
Why we should use OOP?
1) It helps us write large amounts of code easily.
2) It also helps us represent the world around us inside computers easily.
3) Changing code becomes easier.
4) Sharing code and collaboration become easier.
Main Concepts/Main Pillars of OOP:
1) Classes and Objects. (Base not considered main pillar)
2) Inheritance
3)  Polymorphism
4)  Abstraction
5)  Encapsulation.

 Classes and Objects:
    A class is like a map/blueprint/idea/design that we create before we start building the  actual object.
    Classes have properties / attributes which help us figure out how something looks like
    and they have behaviors/functions Which help us understand how something works.
