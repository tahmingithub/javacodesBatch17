Arrays:
     Arrays are datastructures that help us store large amounts of similar data.
     Arrays use indexing to manipulate data inside them. Index always start from zero.
Why should we use arrays?
     Arrays help us store and manipulate large amounts of data easily with the help of loops.
     Whenever we have more than three similar items that we want to store and process together  we should
     always with arrays.
Syntax:
    There are two ways of creating arrays:
    Method1:
    Datatype[] nameOfTHe Array={element1,element 2,element3}
     Method2:
    Datatype[] nameOfTHe Array=new DataType[size or number of elements that we store]
Enhanced For Loop:
    Enhanced for loop is used to iterate through datastructures which has multiple items stored inside them
Why should we use Enhanced For Loop:
    It is simple and easy to understand
Syntax:
    for(DataTypeOfElement any variableName: NameOfTheDataStructure){
    }
    ex:       for(String n: names){
    }
Limitations of Enhanced For Loop:
    1: Enhanced for Loop can't be used for updating the elements.
    2: Access the elements in the reverse order etc.
Break:
    Break keyword is used in switch cases statements and with the loops to terminated the loops prematurely.
Why we should use break keyword:
    Using break keyword can help save a lot of processing  time and our code can execute faster.
Continue:
    Continue keyword is used to skip the code from a loop once we hit the skip keyword
    java ignores the rest of the code int eh loop and jumps to the next iteration.
