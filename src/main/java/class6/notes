Operators:  +, ?, -, *
Operators are symbol which perform an operation on data. There are many different types of operators in Java.
Arithmetic Operators:
   these operators help us perform simple mathematical operations. like
   addition => +   int a=10  int b=20   int c=a+b  => 30
   Subtraction => -
   Multiplication =>  *
   Division=> ?
   Modulus=>%
Shorthand Operators: They help us perform mathematical operations but using a little shorter syntax.
  EX; add and updated the variable  +=   a=10  a+=20   =>30
    subtract and updated the variable. -=  a=10  a-=20   =>10
    Multiply and updated the variable   *=  a=10  a*=20   =>200
    divide and updated the variable   /=  a=10  a /=20   => 0
     Modulus and updated the variable   % =   a=10  a %=20   => 10
Relational Operators:  Help us compare things.
   == check if two objects are equal.
   !=  check if two objects are not equal.
   > greater than than
   < less than
   >= greater than equal
   <= less than equal
Logical Operator:
   They help us combine multiple boolean conditions.
   ! not
   || or
   && and
Increment /Decrement Operators
   ++ this help us increase the  value of a variable by 1
   -- this help us decrease the  value of a variable by 1
While loop  check condition first then executes the code // do while execute code first then check  condition
        // sometimes when we write the logic do while , it becomes easier.
        // There are no other  differences and reasons to use a do while instead of while
