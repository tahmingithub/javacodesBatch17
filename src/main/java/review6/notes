What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
     It is simply a way writing code. Some rules that we follow . There are other ways as well like functional programming, procedural programming.
     There are 4 main pillars of OPP 1: Inheritance (you get something for free) 2: Polymorphism (Many forms)
3:   Abstraction(means not clear) 4 : Encapsulation ( when we want to protect the data, we use this.
Why should we learn OPP:
     1: code re usability
     2: It is easier to write large amounts of code.
     3: Sharing the code with others become easier.
     4: security of the code is increased
     5: changing code becomes easier
Object:
    an object is something that we can physically touch and see. Everything around us like charis tables computer.
    we can easily represent these object inside our computers by telling a computer how an object looks like and how it
    behaves.
Class:
       A class is like a design/map/ blueprint that we use to create objects.
String class:
    A String class is used to store and manipulate text based data. Most of the information inside computers is
    processed in this form.  String is the most widely used class in all java.
Creating object from string class:
1:  length()  2: isEmpty()
