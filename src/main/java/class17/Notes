Inheritance:
     Inheritance allows one class to have all the properties and
     methods from another class except private members and constructors.
     We use extends keyword.
Why should we learn about Inheritance:
    1) Faster development
    2) Saves memory

Syntax:
    class Parent{

    }

    class Child extends Parent{

    }

Rules:
    1) Private members(fields and methods) are not accessible in child classes.
    2) Constructors are also no available for child classes directly.

Types of Inheritance:
1) single:    only one  , one child class and one parent class
2) Hierarchical:  one parent multiple child.      is the most common one
3)multiLevel:     // my  mom inherit from Grandma and i inherit from my mom
4) Hybrid:
5) Multiple :  (It is not supported by java)
===============================================
1) Single Inheritance:
    Only one parent and only one child (Not very common)
2) Hierarchical:
    one parent multiple child.

3) MultiLevel:
    Multiple inheritance happens when a class c inherits from B and B inherits from A . ex:  A (parent)-B-C
4) Hybrid:
      Hybrid is a mixture of Hierarchical and MultiLevel.

5) Multiple: Diamond
Multiple parent classes and one child class. It create problem, ex:diamond problem
if multiple parents for a class , then it is diamond

What is Diamond problem in OOP?
     The ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and a further class D
     inherits from both B and C, so that if there is a method in A that B and/or C has overridden,
     and D does not override it, it is unclear which version of the method D should inherit.

* Tightly couple happen in all Inheritance. If you change one class variable name , it effect every other class.
if you touch class A (String Name;) it effect class B , C and D

*Diamond problem : Diamond Shape        A
              parent B, method        B /\ C   parent C  method
                                        \/
                                         D

                                  A is grandparent, B & C is parent , B and c inherit from parent A,
                                 * B and C is parent and D is child , so D the child get confuse to get method from
                                  parent C pr parent B.
