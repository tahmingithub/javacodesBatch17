Object Oriented Programming: (OOP)
It is just a way (Set of rules) of writing code.
It basically helps us write large amounts of code. That is easier to change and manage. There are other ways like functional
programming and procedural  programming.

Why we should use OOP?
1) It helps us write large amounts of code easily.
2) It also helps us represent the world around us inside computers easily.
3) Changing code becomes easier.
4) Sharing code and collaboration become easier.

Main Concepts/Main Pillars of OOP:
1) Classes and Objects. (Base not considered main pillar)
2) Inheritance
3)  Polymorphism
4)  Abstraction
5)  Encapsulation.

 Classes and Objects:
    A class is like a map/blueprint/idea/design that we create before we start building the  actual object.
    Classes have properties / attributes which help us figure out how something looks like .
    and they have behaviors/functions Which help us understand how something works..


My note:
1.   name.length  ===> number of lettter ex: Tahmin  6 letter
2.  name.toLowerCase())===> change to lowercase letter.
 (name.toUpperCase())===> change to upper case letter
name1.concat(name)===>  add it to name1
.isEmpty();====> check if string is empty or no , use boolean true or false
name.trim())====>   remove all the spaces before and after the String
startsWith===> test if string starts with specific prefix, use boolean true false
str.contains====> test if string contains a specific word  then if found  true and false
name.equals(name2)  ===> if name equals to another name , use boolean true and false
name.equalsIgnoreCase(name2))    ==.  if name equals to another name. ignore upper and lowercase
name.split(" ")  ====> seperate the sentance word by word that first word will be index 0 . ex:  my name is Tahmin
my is 0 index, name is 1 index
